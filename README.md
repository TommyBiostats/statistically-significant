**Identifying the risk factors responsible for maternal mortality in
Bangladesh's rural areas.**


This is my final project for the course 'Data Analysis in Practice'. I had a pleasure of taking this course during my exchange at Kyoto University. The purpose of the work was to identify the risk factors responsible for maternal mortality in Bangladesh's rural areas.
