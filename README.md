My name is Tomasz Baczkun. I am an aspiring professional, currently following a master program in Statistics and Data Science at Leiden University. For those interested, through this repository one can access some of the projects I have worked on so far.

## **Projects**

<br>
<br>

**How does change of site background color influence user behavior?**

Company X in United Kingdom was interested whether changing the background color of their website from white to black would have an effect on the customer conversion rates. In the ecommerce behavioural analysis, I answer this question, provide the extent of the effect and behavioural interpretation, along with insights to the marketing department.

**Shiny R App: Interactive outlier filter with distribution overview.

The app allows users to interactively filter the data in search of outliers per cateogry in any csv dataset. It provides visual distribution of variable of interest given categories and details regarding the outliers.

**Phase III clinical trial analysis of a CardioX hypertension drug**

This is the statistical analysis of a Phase III randomized control clinical trial data. The aim was to assess the efficiency of a new hypertension drug - CardioX (Drug A) - against an active comparator (Drug B) and placebo. Additionally, risk based monitoring (RBM) was conducted.

**Detecting response shift and ‘true’ change with Structural Equation Modelling in Health-Related Quality of Life of Dutch bone metastasis patients undergoing radiotherapy**

Documentation of my bachelor thesis, where I used Structural Equation Modelling in order to identify the change in the well-being of Dutch bone metastasis patients.

The R code can be found in the Appendixes.

**Identifying the risk factors responsible for maternal mortality in
Bangladesh's rural areas**


This is my final project for the course 'Data Analysis in Practice'. I had a pleasure of taking this course during my exchange at Kyoto University. The purpose of the work was to identify the risk factors responsible for maternal mortality in Bangladesh's rural areas.

## **Mini-projects**

<br>
<br>

**List cleaner**

I decided to design a function that would easily extract the necessary information, so either words or number, from the items of a given list. The reasoning behind it is that once I have encountered variables named such as 'fc bayerng modrich.12-05-2012' and it was quite a nightmate - enough of a motivation to build a tool.

**ING in-house project**

Together with my team, I participated in an ING in-house day. We had 50 minutes to analyze a provided dataset and identify the clients worth investing in, aiming to maximize ING’s profit while minimizing CO2 emissions.

**Shiny app: Age filter for clinical trial**

I put together a simple R shiny app that allows a clinician to see the proportion of cured and not cured subjects for any given age group. The data are artificial, made for the sake of the example.
