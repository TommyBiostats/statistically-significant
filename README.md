# truly-biostatstic
The story of how I wanted to fix the world - and ended up doing statistics.

Hey! My name is Tomasz Baczkun. I was many things - theater club member, social volunteer, debater, STEM kid, psychology student. All of them shaped me into who I am today - an aspiring biostatistician, beginning my masters in Statistics and Data Science at Leiden University, determined not to heal the world, but to help those who do. In this blog, I want to share my experiences.
