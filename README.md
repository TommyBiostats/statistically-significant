My name is Tomasz Baczkun. I am an aspiring biostatistician, beginning my masters in Statistics and Data Science at Leiden University. For those interested, through this repository one can acess some projects I have worked on so far.

**Identifying the risk factors responsible for maternal mortality in
Bangladesh's rural areas.**


This is my final project for the course 'Data Analysis in Practice'. I had a pleasure of taking this course during my exchange at Kyoto University. The purpose of the work was to identify the risk factors responsible for maternal mortality in Bangladesh's rural areas.

**Detecting response shift and ‘true’ change with Structural Equation Modelling in Health-Related Quality of Life of Dutch bone metastasis patients undergoing radiotherapy.**

Documentation of my bachelor thesis, where I used Structural Equation Modelling in order to identify the change in the well-being of Dutch bone metastasis patients.

The R code can be found in the Appendixes.

**Simple list cleaner**

I decided to design a function that would easily extract the necessary information, so either words or number, from the items of a given list. The reasoning behind it is that once I have encountered variables named such as 'fc bayerng modrich.12-05-2012' and it was quite a nightmate - enough of a motivation to build a tool.
